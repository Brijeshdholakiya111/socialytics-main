# Socialytics

## Tailwind CSS + TypeScript + Next.js

This is a lightweight starterkit / boilerplate to get up and running with Tailwind CSS, TypeScript and Next.js.

## Usage

### 1. Clone Repo

If you would rather clone this repo, go to the command line and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Brijeshdholakiya111/socialytics-main.git
cd socialytics-main
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install # npm i
```

### 3. Run Development Environment

```bash
pnpm dev # npm run dev
```

### Test Production Environment

I also included a `stage` script that will build and start a production server. You can run it with:

```bash
pnpm stage # npm run stage
```

Alternatively you can run:

```bash
pnpm build # npm run build
pnpm start # npm start
```
